# First blog post

Welcome to my blog about infosec. 

I have set out to try and publish some of my work and my interests in the realm of cyber, mainly as an excercise for myself. But I do hope someone out there will fun the future posting to be of interest, if so feel free to hit me up on my stated socials or follow along here. 

Through my daily work I perform penetration tests of Windows clients as well as environments, and as such most of the topics posted on the blog will be centered around offensive Windows work. I plan to submit **technical details of CVEs, book and content reviews as well as miscellaneous topics**.**
